<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
### Project Overview:

NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit, a library used to deal with NLP applications and `ChatBot` is one among them.

That way, I chose it to build a selflearning ChatBot. I mean, it is trained with a dataset (corpus), but still learns on the fly.

The final product is a ChatBot that can converse in Shakespearean English.

At first,  it was `trained` with the full Shakespeare texts. 

>The 'Term frequency – Inverse document frequency' and 'cosine similarity' Scikit-learn tools were used to create a correlation between terms (Vectorization method).

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Built With:
* **Python Version**: 3.8.8
* **Framework**: Colaboratory from Google.
* **Packages**: NLTK, Scikit-learn, io, random, string, warnings and numpy.





<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation: 
Clone repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/echestare/Chatbot_eng_shakespeare_nltk.git
   ```
In google colab:
- To begin, go to link:
```sh
   https://githubtocolab.com/echestare/Chatbot_eng_shakespeare_nltk/blob/main/Chatbot_eng_shakespeare_nltk.ipynb
   ``` 
- Then run  the following code in the first cell (to upload extra files):

   ```sh
   !git clone https://github.com/echestare/Chatbot_eng_shakespeare_nltk
   ```

<!-- productionization -->
## Productionization:

>This ChatBot requires further on-the-fly training in the area of conversing.

>Perhaps a different algorithm might be more effective. It could be worth experimenting with the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. 

>Other types of data can be used to train it. For instance, some product information, health help, and much more
